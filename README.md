# Rock Paper Scissors Project

This is a Rock Paper Scissors Project that I decided to try after practicing on Codecademy. Codecademy has been a great resource for learning and improving my skills. https://www.Codecademy.com<br>

## Project Overview<br>
The goal of this project was to create a Rock Paper Scissors game using CSS and JavaScript. Throughout the development process, I learned and implemented various techniques and concepts.<br>



<br>Things included and what I've learned:<br>

#### CSS and JavaScript<br>
-Created a title with a text hover slide effect using CSS for an interactive user experience.<br>
-Prevented text highlighting on the page using the user-select property<br>
-Utilized the CSS transitions and animations to achieve smooth image transitions between the main images of rock, paper, and scissors<br>
-Changed the visibility and opacity properties to toggle the display of images.<br>
-Using pointer-events property to enable/disable button functionality<br>

#### JavaScript<br>
-Organizing code by using functions within the main game function for simplicity and reusability in the if-else statements<br>
-Created background div elements through javascript<br>
-Set random positions for the background divs on the screen with no collide<br> 
-Added rotation effects to enhance the visual appeal of the background elements<br>
